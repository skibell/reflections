When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When trying to colaborate with other people and the need to share files is always present.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the remote not always comtain the latest version of the files. We need to use pull only when sharing a copy or downloading it in another computer.
